## Broadcast schedule

The interactive system provides information about the broadcast schedule of TV channels. In particular, original programs with running duration throughout the day. Start timelines are used to mark time, helping viewers look up information about programs, events, and broadcast schedules at their convenience. The end time of the preceding program is the start time of the next program.

Updates via broadcast schedules don't affect viewers' viewing experience.
