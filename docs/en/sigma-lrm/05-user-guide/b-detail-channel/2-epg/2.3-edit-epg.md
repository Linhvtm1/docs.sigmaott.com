## Edit a program

After creating the program, the user updates the program information to correct the desired information.

### At the program information

Edit each program directly on the broadcast schedule, open [program info](2.2-epg-list.md#view-info-program-by-show).

Then, click on the 'Edit' icon.

### At the program listing

When moving your mouse on the 'Edit' icon in the action column, display the line **Edit**.

**Step 2:** Click the 'Edit' icon.

The system will open Pop-up **Edit program** in the right corner of the screen with the information previously entered.

! 

- Allows updating all program content.
- Do not allow duplicate start time updates of existing EPGs.

When the user taps the Edit icon, the system allows editing the program even if the program has an end time before the update time.

**Step 3:** CMS users make edits to the appropriate information and then click 'Confirm'.

The system saves the newly updated information, displays a successful update notification in the right corner of the screen and automatically closes for 5 seconds.

_Notice: Program edit successful!_

### Program editing failed

Similar to creating a new program, to avoid conflicts we do not allow to choose a start time that coincides with an existing program.

The user will receive an error message and can change the start time for editing the program. See [error message](2.1-create-epg#create-new-program-failed) for more details.
