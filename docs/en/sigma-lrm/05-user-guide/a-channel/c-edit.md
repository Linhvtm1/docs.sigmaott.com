# Edit your channel

**Condition**: The channel has been created before and is displayed in the channel list.

Adjustments made during LRM channel modifications will affect the channel's own information and appear on the LRM channel list. At the same time, changes in the broadcast schedule will also be displayed on the timeline and detailed broadcast schedule list of the corresponding channel.

Users of the content management system (CMS) can make edits on the parameters of the channel, including in the case of an active channel.

**Step 1**:

At the main screen interface, users can make edits by moving the mouse on the Edit icon in the Action column at the desired field.

**Step 2:** When the user clicks on the edit icon, the system will display a pop-up **Update channel edit** in the middle of the screen, displaying the previously entered information.
