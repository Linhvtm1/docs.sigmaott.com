### Enable channel sync profiles

Maintaining a synchronized broadcast schedule is critical to providing the best viewing experience for viewers. We recommend that you enable channel sync profiles so that you can proactively sync as needed.
See [proactive sync] instructions(.. /b-detail-channel/2-epg/2.7-manual-sync.md)

Enable synchronous configuration, displaying fields:

| School name | Describe                                          | Compulsory | Data type | Placeholder                       | Rule                                                                        |

### Turn on auto-sync profiles

Proactive synchronization can take up user time. Therefore, we recommend that you enable auto-sync time frame configuration to optimize your time.

Turn on auto-sync, which displays fields:

| **Number of sync days** | Is the number of days the system will proceed to synchronize the broadcast schedule from the time of automatic synchronization. | Not        | Textbox   | Default: 3    | Enter an integer<br />Minimum value = 1 (only the date the synchronization was performed) and maximum =14 |

### Buttons

- **"Cancel" button**: Do not perform a new creation, return to the main screen interface.

- **"Save" button**: Save the newly created information, return to the main screen interface.

## Step 2: Save the configuration

The user enters valid credentials.

Click the **Confirm** button at the bottom of the Pop-up.

The system creates a new channel with the newly entered information, displaying a Pop-up notification **Create new successfully** at the top of the interface.

- The channel turns on synchronous configuration.

- Display all relevant information in channel details.

- Allows synchronous active operations.

## Step 3: Auto-sync

**Condition**: The channel has been enabled for auto-sync and up to the timestamp is configured to sync automatically.

1. The system automatically synchronizes the broadcast schedule.
2. After synchronization

- Show new broadcast schedules on the timeline and program list
- Change the last and next sync information (if applicable).
