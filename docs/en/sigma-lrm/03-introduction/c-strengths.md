The Linear Rights Management (LRM) solution is not an entirely new concept, having been developed and implemented in other countries such as PRISMA-MediaKind and COMCAST TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. However, in Vietnam with special local regulations and requirements to adhere to diverse rights distribution principles, we are proud to be the first and only company in Vietnam to develop LRM solutions. Therefore, our solutions are designed to be completely responsive and suitable for the special context of the Vietnamese market.

Developing an LRM solution brings many benefits to users:

- Provide alternative content options in cases of signal loss, content loss, and device restrictions.

- Make sure that alternative content is delivered to the right audience at the right time.

- LRM works to clarify events and workflows, provide clear and simple tools that can adjust schedules, schedule publications for editors, and meet the diverse needs of individual viewers and devices.

- Users can use the LRM console to view all event data, identify gaps in the program, optional assets to edit/expand events in real time, and verify appropriate alternate content.

- Provides a single feed for data management for both programmers and operators through aggregation of SCTE 224 events.

- It is possible to select many different data sources aggregated through SCTE 224 events but still ensure the synchronization of programs running in the channel.
