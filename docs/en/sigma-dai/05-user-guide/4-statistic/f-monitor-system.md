# System Monitoring

Monitor System is the process of monitoring the system, checking for errors, how much load the system can bear\*\*\*â€¦  Related to the **error problem** leading to the failure to display ads successfully, help users check the cause of the error here and find ways to fix it (currently **group by channel and sub-channel**- Group by channel, group by sub-channel)

## To monitor system monitoring metrics
