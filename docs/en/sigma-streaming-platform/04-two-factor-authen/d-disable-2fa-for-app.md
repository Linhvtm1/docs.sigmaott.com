# Turn off two-factor authentication for apps

This function allows CMS users to disable two-factor authentication for the application when there is no need to use it.

**Condition**:

- User account **has management permissions** and **has two-factor authentication ENABLED**
- The app is in **Enable two-factor authentication**

**Step 1**: In the sidebar, users click on **Manage App**. The system displays the default tab **General Information** of the application

**Step 2**: Users perform **Disable** two-factor authentication of the application in **Security**

The system displays a confirmation pop-up that includes the following information:

- Subject: Turn off two-factor authentication?
- Content: Are you sure you want to turn off two-factor authentication?
- **Cancel** button: No changes, go back to the previous screen
- **OK** button: The system implements **Disable** two-factor authentication for the application

**Step 3**: The user presses the **OK** button to disable two-factor authentication for the application

The system displays a pop-up message **Disable two-factor authentication for application success!** in the right corner of the screen and automatically closes the notification after 5 seconds.

At the same time, the system implements **Disable two-factor authentication for the application**, and **does not require** all members of the application when accessing the application to enable two-factor authentication for the account
