# List of members

Member lists to manage, track, and adjust members. This list is automatically updated to reflect any changes in the member community.

To ensure security, only users with access can view the member list. The account that created the application will be set up by default with full permissions, including permission to view and manage the member list.

In addition, this feature helps administrators understand the structure, number and tasks of each member, thereby optimizing the process of managing and interacting with members.

## View member list

When users are on any page in the app, they can take the following steps to view and manage the membership list:

**Step 1**: Click 'App Settings' on the Sidebar.

The default page displays **app information**.

**Step 2**: Switch to the 'Members' tab.

_Member list interface_

After creating the application, in the default members list, only one member is the user's main account. Information about this member includes:

- Creation time, recorded as the time the app was created.
- 'Joined' status.
- The 'delete' icon is disabled.

When a new member is added to the list, the system displays the following information:

- **STT**: Order from 1 to n (where n is the number of members, including user accounts).
- **Email**: The user's primary email address.
- **Group** : Shows the group that the user configured when inviting additional members.
- **Condition**:
  - Joined: Joined.
  - Invited: Send an email invitation but haven't joined yet.
- **Time**: When to send the invitation.
- **Action**:
  - 'Resend' icon: resend the invitation.
  - 'Delete' icon: allows the user to perform corresponding actions.

**Step 3**: View the information.

Alternatively, users can perform a quick filter by 'searching emails' or selecting 'status'.
