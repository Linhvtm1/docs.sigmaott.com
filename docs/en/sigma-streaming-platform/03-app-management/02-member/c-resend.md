# Resend invitations

After inviting members, if the check finds that **email does not yet exist** in the system and the previous invitation has not received a response, the user can choose to resend the invitation.

Once users are in the members list view, they can perform the following steps:

Step 1: Click the 'Resend' button in the email's 'Actions' column in the list with the status as 'Invited'.

Display a confirmation window with options:

! [Resend invitation] (/images/streaming-platform/app-management/02-member/pop-up/resend.png)

_Resend invitation_

- **Subject**: Resend invitation?
- **Content**: Are you sure you want to resend the invitation?
- 'Cancel' button: Returns to the members list without saving the information.
- 'Confirm' button: Confirm the re-sending of the invitation.

**Step 2**: Click the 'Confirm' button.

The user will be taken back to the members list and see a message confirming that the invitation was successfully resent.

At the same time, the system will automatically resend the invitation email through the selected email address.

Some notes:

- There are no restrictions on the continuous sending of invitation emails, the latest token is valid.
- The token will automatically expire after '24 hours' from the moment the last invitation email is resent.
- The content of the invitation email when resent will not change from the previous send.
