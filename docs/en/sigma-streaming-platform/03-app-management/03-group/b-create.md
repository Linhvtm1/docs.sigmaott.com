# Group

A group access hierarchy helps ensure that each member can only use features that are appropriate for their roles and permissions. To optimize the process of managing groups and permissions, the system supports the creation of many different permission groups. Each group can be personalized with a special access name and configuration.

By decentralizing, administrators can flexibly set up and manage permission groups, optimize user experience, and secure information during application usage.

## Create a group

To create a new permission group, members have access to the management app and perform the group creation process by following these steps:

1. Access the **Group List** interface in the management app.
2. Click the 'Add' button to open the permission group creation pop-up.

The pop-up creates permission groups that include the following fields:

- Title: Create Group
- Group Name: Enter a name for the new permission group.
- Permissions: Select permissions for the group, there are two options:
  - 'Admin': Has full access to all functions.
  - 'Viewer': Only access is available for viewing.
- Detailed Access Permissions:

  - Product: Control access for each in-app product.
  - Library: Manage and adjust machines and assets in the application to ensure efficient, optimal, default operation with 'Viewer' permissions.

The system limits a maximum of 20 groups (not counting the default 4 groups). To ensure convenience and clarity in the management process, the create group button will not be displayed in the **Invite members** pop-up if this limit has been reached.

3. Enter Group Information and Set Permissions
   Enter a name for the group and select the corresponding permission level.
   Press the 'Save' button to complete the group creation process.
4. Create a successful team
   After pressing 'Save', the system will display the group list again, a success message at the top of the screen. The newly created group will be displayed at the top of the list, making it easy for users to identify and manage their new group.

_Announcement: Successful team creation!_

In addition, notifications about new groups will also appear in the **Invite Members** pop-up, helping users invite members to the group conveniently and quickly. This helps optimize the user experience and keeps the team management process flexible and easy.
