## Group list

To manage groups and display their basic information, the system is designed in the form of lists, which provides the ability to perform flexible management operations. For displays, the maximum number of display groups is limited to 20 (excluding the default 4 groups).

Users can access the group list from the main screen of the system by selecting **Group list**. The interface of the home screen includes:

- **Group Name**: Configured by CMS users.
- **Creation Time**: The time when the system records the creation of the group, the format is YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss.
- **Permissions**: Describes the permissions that each team member - has in the app.
- **Action**:
  - Delete: Allows CMS users to delete groups.
  - Edit: Allows CMS users to edit group information.

The group list includes 4 default groups, but they will not appear directly on the list, but only show up in the **invite members** pop-up.
